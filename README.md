# Real-time-Emotion-Detection
I developed a real-time emotion detection system designed to analyze students' facial expressions during classroom sessions. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), trained on the FER-2013 dataset.

**Implementation:** The model is deployed on a Jetson Nano, using a webcam for real-time emotion recognition. It classifies expressions into seven categories: angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised.
**Challenges Overcome:** Successfully addressed issues related to OpenCV compatibility, optimizer errors, and the challenges of training on a large dataset.
**Future Plans**: There are plans to integrate this system into a classroom management platform, featuring a web dashboard for real-time emotional monitoring.
**Skills Utilized**
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
